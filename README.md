# Sample-WebRTC

This is sample WebRTC based project, to establish VOIP Connection, using Bluetooth Signaling. It's already support configuration from code, and primary Renegotiation functions. But, **PLEASE NOTE**, version still unstable, and we will update project as soon, as possible! To stabilize work, and include interesting features, like Conference and Data Channel.
